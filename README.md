# Starcraft Player Performance
The Starcraft player dataset contains player performance data in ranked games. In this notebook, we will explore the player performance wrt their league, perform feature selection and finally, train different models to predict the league index for the user that played the given game. The following models are used to predict the league index:
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. LightGBM
4. Feedforward Neural Network
